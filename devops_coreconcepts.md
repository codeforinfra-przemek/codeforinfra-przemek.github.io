# DevOps Foundations: Core Concepts and Fundamentals

## Lean Software Development

Lean software development is an agile methodology that focuses on delivering customer value by eliminating waste, increasing efficiency, and developing high-quality software. Its core principles include eliminating waste, building quality in, creating knowledge, deferring commitment, delivering fast, respecting people, and optimizing the whole. The approach originated from lean manufacturing principles, like the Toyota Production System.

Core principles
- Eliminate waste: Remove any activity that does not add value for the customer.
- Build quality in: Make quality a continuous process to prevent defects, rather than trying to fix them later.
- Create knowledge: Learn and share knowledge throughout the development process through activities like testing, feedback, and collaboration.
- Defer commitment: Make decisions as late as possible based on facts and customer needs, rather than making them too early and having to change them later.
- Deliver fast: Accelerate the delivery of software to get feedback and value to the customer sooner.
- Respect people: Empower the team, encourage communication, and involve everyone in solving problems.
- Optimize the whole: Look at the entire development process to ensure all parts work together seamlessly, rather than focusing on optimizing individual pieces in isolation.
