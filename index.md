# Hi, I'm Przemek 👋

I design and build infrastructure and platforms in the SRE / DevOps / platform engineering space.

This site is a collection of technical notes and write-ups that show how I approach problems in production systems: from network automation and CI/CD to Kubernetes, storage and observability.

Here you will find:

- **Case studies** – concrete projects and delivered outcomes  
- **Deep-dives / technical write-ups** – detailed exploration of specific topics  
- **Engineering stories** – how I reason about trade-offs and design decisions  
- **Postmortems** – what went wrong and what I learned from it
